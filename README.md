# DOM Manipulation Project

## Overview

This project involves manipulating a DOM element fetched by its ID. Follow these steps to enhance the appearance of the target element named `targetDiv`. JavaScript is utilized to change the background color to yellow, add a 20-pixel margin, apply a 10-pixel padding, set the font size to 18 pixels, make the font weight bold, adjust the height to 200 pixels, and modify the width to 300 pixels.
